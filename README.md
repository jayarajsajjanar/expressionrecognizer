Representation Learning: Automatic Feature Engineering for Facial Expression Recognition				                    
1	Built a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to learn representations and classify images on FER2013 dataset using keras.
2	Evaluated regularization techniques like dropout and data augmentation, and optimizers like Adam and Adadelta.
3	Achieved an accuracy of 64.92% on test images which had an human accuracy of 65Â±5%.
